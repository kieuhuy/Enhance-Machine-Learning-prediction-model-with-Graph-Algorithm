# Enhance Machine Learning prediction model with Graph Algorithm
The main goal of this project is to build the machine learning model to perform the link prediction task on the provided graph, and then add new features created by the community detection algorithm to the training model to examine the effect of the algorithms on the prediction model's performance. The following tools will be used to complete the work: neo4j platform, python libraries, PySpark, and Spark MLlib. In brief, neo4j will be utilized to develop a graph database capable of handling the graph created from the specific dataset. Following that, the process of developing and executing the machine learning model will be carried out with the assistance of PySpark DataFrame, which is in charge of storing and preprocessing the dataset, and Spark MLlib, which is in charge of building and executing the machine learning model.
